This is my first hands-on experience using microservice and docker that learned from a Udemy course teaching by Mehmet Ozkaya, In this course Iv'e used a variety kind of tools,technologies and architectures such as rabbitMq, MassTransit, Sq Server, Postgressql, redis, ocelot gateway, cqrs, mediateR, etc.

This project utilizes packaging through docker images that enables us to run our application in an independent environment, regardless of running machine  types, for example linux or windows.
